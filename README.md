<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ajay Soni</h1>
<h5>Hello! I am a passionate student currently pursuing B.Tech from the Radharaman Institute of Technology and Science. With a keen interest in problem-solving and a knack for programming, I am excited to enhance my skills and knowledge to positively impact the world of technology. </h5>

<h5>
Throughout my academic journey, I have gained expertise in C, C++ with STL, and Data Structures and Algorithms. These foundational skills have allowed me to develop a strong understanding of programming principles and problem-solving techniques. I have actively engaged in various coding competitions, honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in the process.

In addition to my proficiency in programming, I am actively involved in Android app development using the native language, Java. This experience has allowed me to explore the world of mobile applications and develop a solid understanding of the Android platform. I am currently working on building an Android project that showcases my skills and will serve as a valuable addition to my resume.

I participated in coding contests on platforms like LeetCode, GFG, and CodeChef, where I achieved an impressive rank of 3104 out of 23000+ students in LeetCode, 364th rank in GFG, and 244th rank (div 2) in CodeChef. 

Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email. I am always open to new opportunities, connections, and conversations.g. </h5>
